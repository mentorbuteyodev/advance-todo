This workflow automates the process of adding all changes, committing them with a message, and pushing to the remote repository.

1. Stage all changes
   // turbo
2. `git add .`

3. Commit changes (user will be prompted for message if -m is not provided)
   // turbo
4. `git commit -m "update: automated commit and push"`

5. Push to remote main branch
   // turbo
6. `git push origin main`
